# Interactive Persistent Homology Demo

## Overview
This project is an interactive web application that demonstrates the basics of persistent homology, a key concept in topological data analysis. It visualizes how the shape and connectivity of a set of points changes as we vary a radius parameter.

## Features
- Generates an irregular 2D point cloud.
- Displays circles of adjustable radius around each point.
- Shows a persistence diagram that captures the birth and death of topological features as the radius changes.
- Interactive slider to dynamically update the radius and visualize changes in real-time.
- Built using Python, Dash, and Plotly for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
